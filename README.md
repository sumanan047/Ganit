# Ganit: A Mathematical Calculation Library

This repository contains a library for solving simple partial differential equations. The library is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to use.

## Features

* **Finite Difference Equations:** with simple boundary conditions and initial conditions.

## Installation

This will be updated soon.

## Usage

nietzsche is a python package so it can be imported into your project to solve partial differential equations.  See the example in `example_script.py` and the demonstration below.
